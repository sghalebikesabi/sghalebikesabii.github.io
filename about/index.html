<h1> About me </h1>

As you probably know I am a DPhil student in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford. I studied for a BSc in Mathematics and a BSc in Economics and Business Admistration at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz University Hannover. After that, I did a MSc in Statistics (Research) where I got interested in statistical machinelearning. I was born in Iran and grew up in Germany. In my free time, I love reading books and travel around Europe.
